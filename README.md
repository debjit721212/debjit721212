### 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate and growth-driven **AI & Computer Vision Engineer** with over **3 years of experience** in transforming real-world problems into scalable, high-performance deep learning and GenAI solutions.

💡 I specialize in:
- Building end-to-end vision pipelines for **surveillance & safety**
- Developing **RAG-enabled tools** for enterprise search
- Integrating **LLMs and agents** into real-world applications
- Working with multimodal systems (VLMs, MCPs, etc.)
- Scaling CV deployments with **DeepStream, TensorRT**
